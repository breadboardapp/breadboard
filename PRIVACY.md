# Privacy Policy for Breadboard

**Last Updated:** 30 July 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Breadboard ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

### Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be clear: Breadboard is designed with your privacy in mind.

- **No Sale of Personal Data:** We do not sell, rent, or trade any of your personal data to third parties.
- **No Analytics or Usage Stats:** We do not collect analytics or usage statistics about how you interact with the App.

### Information We Process and Why

The core purpose of Breadboard is to help you retrieve data from external platforms. To facilitate this, the following information is used:

- **IP Address for External Requests:** When you use Breadboard to fetch data from an external platform, your device's IP address will be used to make these requests. This is a standard part of how the internet works. We do not store your IP address. You should consult the privacy policy of the specific external platforms you interact with through Breadboard to understand how they handle your IP address and any other data they may collect.
- **Optional API Credentials:** Breadboard allows you to optionally provide API credentials (such as API keys or tokens) for specific external platforms to enable enhanced functionality.
  - **Purpose and Sharing:** These credentials will be stored on your device and will **only** be shared with the specific external platform they are intended for. These credentials will be used solely for the purpose of authenticating your requests to that platform and enabling the enhanced functionality on the platform.
  - **User Control:** You are in control of providing these credentials and can revoke them at any time through the App's settings.

### Post Recommendations

To enhance your experience, Breadboard offers a feature to recommend posts based on content you have previously added to your favourites within the App.

- **How it Works:** When you use this feature, Breadboard sends aggregated metadata derived from your favourited posts as a search query to the relevant external platform. For example, if you have favourited several posts with specific tags or keywords, Breadboard might use these common tags or keywords to find similar content on that platform.
- **Data Sent:** Only the aggregated metadata (like common tags, categories, or keywords) is sent to the external platform as a search query. We do not send your specific list of favourited posts or any personally identifiable information from your device to the external platform for this purpose.
- **Purpose:** The sole purpose of sending this aggregated metadata is to retrieve recommendations for similar posts from the external platform.
- **User Control:** You can choose not to use this functionality by not visiting the "Browse" page within the App. You can set the App's "Start page" setting to something other than "Browse" to prevent this feature from automatically working when you open the App.

### Data Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect the information we process. When you provide API credentials, they are stored locally on your device, the App's developers do not have access to these credentials, and they are only used for the purpose of making requests to the external platforms you choose to interact with.

As Breadboard does not store any personal data off-device, we do not have a process for you to request deletion of personal data. You can, however, delete any stored API credentials through the App, or clear the App's data through your device settings, which will remove all locally stored information.

### Third-Party Services

As mentioned, Breadboard interacts with external platforms. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access through Breadboard.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised.

### Your Consent

By using the Breadboard app, you consent to our Privacy Policy.
